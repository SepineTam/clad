1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Bang-dah

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,939
Okay, another video shows the main straight rows in the history to style

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,480
This is a bit longer than that

4
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,420
It's important to have a transcendent network straight and in the history

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,659
The distances gradually extend and the first real trade routes appear

6
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:09,200
One of the earliest known routes is called the Incess Road

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,400
From around 1800 BC

8
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:20,039
Navigators begin to travel along the coast between the Indian subcontinent where spices such as black pepper and cinnamon are found

9
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:25,700
And the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula where a tree that produces asus grows

10
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:32,900
Drone-airy caravans then transport these luxury products across the Indian desert to Petra

11
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,000
Which becomes an important commercial crossroad between Egypt and Mesopotamia

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,960
In 331 BC, Alexander the Great during his conquests found the city of Alexandria

13
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,200
Soon merchant ships linked the new city to the rest of the Mediterranean basin

14
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,439
Alexandria then becomes the Great Warehouse for trade between India and Europe

15
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,400
In East Turkestan, Jade is found

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,480
This precious stone is much sought after in China as it's a sign of power and wealth

17
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,560
No nads then engage in Jade trade with the Chinese, notably exchanging at 13

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,080
A drink much appreciated in irid environments

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,840
But further north, a confederation of nomadic tribes spreads and threatens China

20
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,840
In 139 BC, the Chinese Emperor Sanzh Zhang Qian has emasodered to the unknown lands in the west

21
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,480
There to propose an alliance to the Yuzhai against the Zhanyu

22
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,000
But Zhanyuan is captured by the Zhanyu

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,280
In his health prisoner for 13 years, on his return to China, he reports to the emperor all he's worth

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,759
Regarding the various peoples of Central Asia and their products

25
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:59,039
He mentions in particular on the gestic race of horses unknown in China

26
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,800
In order to obtain some of these horses, the emperor agrees for the first time to trade silk

27
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,240
Which had been further into the exporter to till that

28
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,760
This is the opening of the silk roach, which gradually extends to the Middle East

29
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,680
In the west, after the death of Cleopatra, Egypt is ensured by the Roman Republic

30
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,400
Which is in the midst of the Khanian Empire

31
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,640
Rome is now able to increase its supply of wheat from Egypt

32
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,719
But it covers above all goods from the Arabian peninsula

33
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,479
Such as pearls, spices, and especially incense

34
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,280
Which is used for off-road medicine

35
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,560
But there are many intermediaries and the instability in the region is great

36
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,960
To bypass the Arabian Peninsula, the Romans go up the Nile

37
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,159
And come to contact with the Kingdom of Opsum

38
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,199
Where merchants live, who master techniques of navigation on the high seas

39
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,159
The Romans then open a new route to India

40
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,000
From the coast, they import notably Safran, Perfumes, and Diamonds

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,400
The new trade route develops rapidly, initiating the decline of the cities of the Arabian Peninsula

42
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,719
Soon after, the Romans come to contact with the parliants who import silk from China

43
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,560
The Romans then extend the silk route throughout their empire

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,759
In 224, the parliens fall and are replaced by the susivites, but trade continues

45
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,920
The Roman Empire then moves its capital to Constantinople

46
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,319
Which becomes the new commercial crossroads between East and West

47
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,279
Hi there, did you know?

48
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,000
It's a perfectly made way for a government city

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,279
And a 1 million pound a year completely taxed

50
00:04:53,599 --> 00:05:05,359
From year 630 onwards, Muslim conquests threaten the Byzantine and Stassinian empires

51
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:11,199
By CC Alexanderia, the Arabs cut the road between India and Constantinople

52
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,559
By expanding Eastward, they now fight over the territories of Central Asia with China

53
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:19,199
Which wants to make it its protectorate

54
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,519
In 751, the two powers clash in Tolis

55
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,079
The battle turns to the advantage of the Arabs who take Chinese prisoners

56
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,480
Who confess to them the secrets of paper and silk manufacturing

57
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,680
After its defeat, China turns away from landlords to concentrate on seeruts

58
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,039
Which are safer and have fewer intermedia areas

59
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,719
The country then opens its ports to foreign traders

60
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:52,320
The Arabs quickly seize this opportunity and establish themselves at the center of a vast commercial network

61
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,720
The Arabs produce among other things

62
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,960
Carbants, they mine cobalt blue and they breed horses

63
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,560
In China, they also supply themselves with horse-led

64
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,400
In Southeast Asia and India, in addition to spices, they buy precious stones

65
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,440
In Africa, the trade of gold, slaves and ivory is growing

66
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,040
Finally, in the north, the Kazaners and the Byzantine empires supply them with European

67
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,439
products such as birds, honey, wood and slaves

68
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:29,920
At the heart of this immense network, Arab cities in full expansion develop rapidly

69
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,040
In Central Asia, nomadic turkey tribes threaten the Arab cowfights

70
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,680
Among them, the subject Turks seize Jerusalem in 1076

71
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,080
Christians who go out pilgrimage to the city are secretly persecuted

72
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,280
In reaction, hope urban the second launches a crusade to Jerusalem

73
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,640
The Italian republics that mastered navigation, CA, commercial opportunity

74
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,600
They offer to supply the Christians in the Near East

75
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,920
Where they attain commercial privileges in each of the conquered cities

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,560
In 1204, the Republic of Venice diverts the fourth crusade towards Constantinople

77
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,360
Which is besieged and then pillaged

78
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,280
The Byzantine empires dismantled, which allows the Italian republics to take over the trade

79
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Be prune east and west all around the Mediterranean basin

80
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,720
In the north of Europe, several trading cities join together to develop a trade route

81
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,200
Between the Baltic and the North Sea

82
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,200
You've got exports first, rega, producers grain

83
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,840
While Scandinavia exports herring

84
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,560
In the North Sea, textile producers spring up in Flanders and England

85
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,800
In 1453, the Turks seize Constantinople

86
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,480
De-stabilizing the trade routes between Asia and Europe

87
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,920
Portugal takes advantage of the creation of the caravale

88
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:08,080
A large ship capable of tackling the oceans to begin explorations and an attempt to open new maritime trade routes

89
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,480
Along the African coasts, the Portuguese establish trading posts

90
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,360
And take over the slave and gold trades

91
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,520
The objective is now to bypass Africa to reach the Andes

92
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,800
The Spanish monarchy also aims at the Andes

93
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,920
But tries its luck with westward exploration

94
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,080
Thus discovering America

95
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:34,079
Portugal finally reaches the port of Calcutta and discovers a large commercial network

96
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:38,799
A man-look fleet is then charged with chasing away the new competitors

97
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,079
But the Portuguese prevail and quickly take control of key cross-boys

98
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:47,600
Gaining a monopoly on trade in the Indian Ocean

99
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,360
By bringing Asian goods directly to Europe via Africa and without intermediaries

100
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,919
Portugal becomes rich very quickly

101
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,959
At the expense of the powers that control the passage via the Middle East

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,679
To avoid competition around a newly discovered territories

103
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:13,279
Spain and Portugal agree in 1494 to draw the tortoiseous meridian

104
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,799
The territories to the east can be claimed by Portugal

105
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,879
Those to the west by Spain

106
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:24,480
In America, the Spanish conquistadors discover products unknown in the ancient world

107
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,840
Such as tomatoes, tobacco and potatoes

108
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,120
But in Europe at first, it's mainly the discovery of chocolate that interests them

109
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,159
The Cocoa trade develops as well as imports of precious medicine pearls

110
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,720
Which are the result of the conquest

111
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,320
But Spain still aims to reach the Andes from the west

112
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,720
Finally, Ferdinand Magellan succeeds in bypassing America

113
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,000
And after his death, his crew reaches the mollacas

114
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,399
Where nutmeg and cloves grow

115
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,600
But the Portuguese are already present in the region

116
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,480
And after conflicts, the two countries establish a new division line

117
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,679
But Spain colonizes the Philippines anyway

118
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:11,120
In order to develop trade there, the Spaniards have to avoid the Portuguese territories

119
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,279
And they head back to the Pacific

120
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,600
But the sea currents push them back

121
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,480
In 1565, the return route is finally found further north

122
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,240
It makes it possible to link Manila with Ocapolgo

123
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,360
In America, the Spaniards discover silver mines

124
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Which are then intensively exploited using natives as labor

125
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,200
The precious metal is loaded into galleons in Caillão

126
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,920
Which lead for Ocapolgo and Manila

127
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,800
In the Philippines, Chinese merchants exchange the silver for spices

128
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,680
Tea, silk and porcelain which are then brought back to Ocapolgo

129
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,159
The silver and Chinese products are then transported to Veracruz

130
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,599
From where Convoys leave Regulio for Seville

131
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:03,519
While the Iberian Peninsula is rapidly becoming richer

132
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,799
The Dutch, the English and the French attempt in turn to seize trade routes

133
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,839
They found trade posts along the African coast and in the Indian Ocean

134
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,920
They then conquered territories, notably the Caribbean islands

135
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,200
Where they developed huge sugarcane plantations

136
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,920
Which required a large workforce

137
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:32,080
In Western Europe, slave traders leave with crockery, weapons and tools that they exchange in the Gulf of Guinea for slaves

138
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,440
The slaves are then transported under extremely poor conditions to the Americas

139
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,800
As sold to sugarcane and coffee plantations

140
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,799
As well as to mines such as diamond mines in Brazil

141
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,240
The ships then returned to Europe loaded with sugar

142
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,359
To back up, rum and precious stones

143
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:55,919
This trade becomes very profitable attracting new investors

144
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:01,039
Over a 200 year period between 7 and 20 million Africans

145
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,719
Depending on estimates are transported to America

146
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:09,919
During the 19th century, the abolition of slavery gradually puts an end to this

147
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,919
trying your trade

148
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,799
In Great Britain and industrial revolution begins

149
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,959
Thanks largely to the development of the coal-fired steam-matchet

150
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,679
With the mechanization of the weaving loan, craftsmen become workers and the textile industry bums

151
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,879
As a result, the demand for cotton jumped

152
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,759
Until then, it came mainly from India

153
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,679
Now, huge plantations are developed in the Caribbean and in the Southern United States

154
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,799
The United Kingdom produces a great deal of textiles at a reasonable price

155
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,919
And is looking for new markets to sell its goods

156
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,919
At the same time, iron and steel techniques are perfected

157
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,639
In the country, becomes the largest exporter of iron in the world

158
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,799
Iron and the steam engine revolutionized transportation

159
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:09,039
The first railroad line leaks the textile factories of Manchester to the port of Liverpool

160
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,120
Where shipments of American and Indian raw cotton arrive

161
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,839
On the seas, steamships gradually begin replacing sailing ships

162
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,759
The United Kingdom's strengthens its maritime domination

163
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,759
Seizes many territories

164
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,599
It develops a powerful colonial and commercial network

165
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,120
The batteries, the perfect workflow, doesn't exist

166
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,759
The good news is you can make yourself a money dot pop

167
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,960
Let us show you how I use my dot pop to create a team

168
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:54,800
In 1854, France intends permission from Egypt to build a canal linking the Mediterranean to the Red Sea

169
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,120
Such a canal had already been built in ancient times by the Ferrells

170
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,679
But had disappeared by the 8th century

171
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,679
In 1869, the Suisse canal is inaugurated

172
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,719
It makes it possible to travel the route to India in 60 days on a steamship

173
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:14,719
Compared to six months with a sailing ship via Africa

174
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:19,519
However, the European powers do not turn away from the African continent

175
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,919
After expeditions in went, European countries meet in Berlin

176
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,599
To divvy up Africa and regulate colonization

177
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:32,240
The peoples of Africa are subject to it and their resources plundered

178
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,559
In the south, large reserves of gold and diamonds are discovered

179
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,759
In central Africa, ivory is exploited

180
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,879
In addition, huge plantations are developed

181
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,719
Notably for rubber, necessary for the manufacturer of roots

182
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,079
And tires for the developing automobile industry

183
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,240
Plantations also appear for coffee, cocoa, tobacco

184
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,639
In other products that are intended for the European and American markets

185
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,639
In America, the United States extends its influence

186
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:09,840
In 1904, they buy from the French, the abandoned construction site for an inter-oceanic canal

187
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:16,080
The canal would considerably shorten the maritime route between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans

188
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,840
10 years later, the Panama Canal is inaugurated

189
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,080
With this new key passageway controlled by the United States

190
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:35,200
During World War I, new oil-powered weapons are here on land at sea and in the air

191
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,040
At the end of the war, the demand for oil sky-rockets

192
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,800
While the automobile and aviation industries developed

193
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,720
At that time, oil comes mainly from the United States

194
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,120
Mexico and the Caspian Sea

195
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:56,720
But soon, especially after World War II, huge deposits are discovered in the Middle East and America

196
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,800
This strategic resource becomes abundant and cheap and all trade intensifies

197
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,000
The aviation boom makes it possible to trade across the world via the air

198
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,800
This is the beginning of globalization

199
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,960
That is, the acceleration of trade on worldwide scale

200
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,920
But the situation in the Middle East and Africa is increasingly unstable

201
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,080
In 1967, the Six-Day War takes place

202
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,480
Israel occupies the Sinai up to the banks of the Suez Canal

203
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,519
Which is then closed for eight years, forcing ships to bypass Africa

204
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:40,800
In addition, in the 1970s, two oil shocks caused the price of oil to increase dramatically

205
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,079
Countries that depend on this so-called black gold

206
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,599
Without producing it, turn to other types of energy, including nuclear power

207
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:52,799
Uranium becomes a very popular resource

208
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,479
Mainly extracted from mines in Canada and the Congo

209
00:16:56,479 --> 00:17:00,159
New deposits are quickly exploited all over the world

210
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,799
In the 1980s and 1980s, the United States sees a boom

211
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,919
And a relatively new and very promising sector

212
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,800
Electronics and computer technologies

213
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:16,000
Apple launches their first personal computer and its intermediate success

214
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,560
Japan quickly follows the USA

215
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,160
Beginning a period of desolate technological development

216
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,360
In its automobile and electronics industries

217
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,039
Several countries in the Far East are inspired by Japan

218
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,800
And specialize in the export of electronic components

219
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,039
Rare earth metals needed in the manufacture of electronics

220
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,680
Become a strategic raw material

221
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,920
Well the vast majority of the deposits are discovered in China

222
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,879
In 2001, China becomes a member of the World Trade Organization

223
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:57,440
The country attracts foreign companies thanks to its cheap labor force

224
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,440
At the same time, advantages are granted to foreign investors

225
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,920
And export quotas are abolished

226
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,440
Soon, textiles made in China, flood American and European markets

227
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,039
Many companies relocate their factories to China

228
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,240
The country gradually becomes the world's factory

229
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,759
With its economy experiencing explosive growth

230
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,000
Allowing for rapid development

231
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,960
To secure its economy in 2013, the country begins the creation of the new soap roads

232
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,640
The objective is to ensure its supply of raw materials

233
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,560
And also to increase its exports of manufactured products

234
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,480
Steel and aluminum

235
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,240
Throughout the world, roads, railroads and seaports are massively financed by China

236
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,080
With the aim of connecting the country to all continents

237
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,400
New initiatives are being discussed

238
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,040
Such as the construction of a railor line

239
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,680
That would link China to the United States

240
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,840
Through a tunnel under the barren street

241
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,480
Or the construction of an inter-Ocean canal in Nicaragua

242
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,440
While some countries are opposed to this project

243
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,279
China has already convinced about 140 countries to host these new silk roads

244
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,400
Which should be finalized by 2049

245
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,279
When the peoples Republic of China will celebrate its 100th anniversary

246
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,880
According to some estimates

247
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,599
The world's largest trade is in arms

248
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,360
Followed by the drug trade

249
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,319
With an estimated annual turnover of nearly $500 billion

250
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,319
This clandestine trade is controlled by criminal networks

251
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,799
Opium poppy saw produced in Asia

252
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,759
In the Golden Triangle and the Golden Crescent

253
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,039
Cannabis resin is mainly produced in Morocco

254
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,159
In cocaine comes mainly from Colombia

255
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:52,719
The drugs are transported by different rules

256
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:54,799
To Europe and the United States

257
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,879
Which are the biggest consumers

258
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,880
Today the main maritime trade route circles below

259
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,840
Passing through strategic streets and channels

260
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,000
It passes through North America

261
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,280
The Panama Canal

262
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,920
Europe

263
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,120
The Mediterranean

264
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,480
The Suez Canal

265
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,600
The Indian Ocean

266
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,720
And Asia

267
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,560
Moreover the search for new trade routes never stops

268
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,840
At the North Pole

269
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,800
The melting of the ice caused by climate change

270
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,960
Makes it possible to envisage the opening of new maritime routes

271
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,720
That are short and therefore less costly in terms of fuel

272
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,880
While also avoiding taxes

273
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,200
Living when having to pass through the Suez for Panama canals

274
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,519
These new routes could benefit Russia and Canada in particular

275
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,039
The major powers well understand the stakes at play

276
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,519
In these potential future routes

277
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,240
The United States and the European Union

278
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
Are demanding free navigation

279
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,240
While China intends to develop a polar so corroded

280
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,680
If China dollar makes use of the ship

281
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,279
What is the main demand for US-level solar naval fishing targets

282
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:12,000
And what is the CCP's largestそうですね model

283
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,600
Because only Chinese can implement European technologies

284
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,160
Since expectancy is only told

285
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,840
Then theres the ship will be in poor Temperature

286
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:29,919
in case tree and what happened to die and then before we go with the discussion

287
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:45,279
of the globalization means them. I like to talk something about the classes

288
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,720
right so all the slides you will be here, all main slides you will be here

289
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:56,440
and the materials here, so it goes the slides and then we will have a textbook

290
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,559
and we sometimes will follow the textbook that this one can be downloaded

291
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:07,559
here there's an introduction to internet economics there's new perspective

292
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:13,519
on the global economy so given down this one and there are four

293
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:21,440
assessments of this course here

294
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,720
assessments

295
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:36,079
yeah this will include the assessment of course including the assignments

296
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:41,119
and there will be some team works and also checkings and some others so okay

297
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:48,799
so all the best but yeah there's three parts of this so we have several assignments

298
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,000
and also team works here so three parts of this and another one will be

299
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:01,919
got another one with offline this will be some interaction or your performance

300
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:08,799
in the class and the after class okay so there'll be a 10% will be

301
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,799
say there's there's going to be controlled or there to be say there's to be

302
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:23,200
controlled by by the professors teachers that gets 10% of offline okay so and sometimes

303
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,720
let me go some of the the materials or sometimes we will give some some readings but not a week

304
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,119
by week so there's got some some readings but but this is not important if I assign some readings

305
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:43,439
if I assign some reading I will put them under this folder okay and this one this one is not

306
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:47,439
important this one is not too important

307
00:23:47,440 --> 00:24:06,480
so we'll continue to discuss the globalization

308
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:21,519
so what's the situation of the current globalization something like this

309
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:35,039
as we know from the other second world then again here we've got a different terms for globalization

310
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,599
one of them a difference maybe that I do the generalization two in the three rights

311
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:50,079
after we'll want to see here shows the choice important exports as a percentage of GDP in the world

312
00:24:51,039 --> 00:25:02,319
increase from 15% to about 17 18% then this maybe that's the eighties okay that's the eighties

313
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:13,039
85 86 86 here increase to 2008 about two Sundays this is about close to 30% and then it's

314
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:21,839
very slowly like this so we got a three terms here for globalization after second world the first

315
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:28,480
one in globalization second hyper globalization and now we're in the purge of the

316
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:36,160
globalization that means now we are moving fast love like this snow the

317
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:46,400
why so there's some people say that the globalization now is the peak and then we move down from the peak

318
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:53,839
because as we just see here now this is a peak and then go down here right

319
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:01,519
got them but we see also see the slope now from positive slope to a bit negative slope here

320
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:16,159
and then but then this is not the real case as we see of the details if you say there's the peak

321
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,360
globalization that means they asked all right the highest of the

322
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,560
traits as question of GDP so people say that the globalization now is stopped or this is

323
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:35,440
globalization or this they are declining that decalbellization we're not connecting with one another

324
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:44,800
now so and then here we choose will be some forces is not

325
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:58,880
two right so because even if we see this very similar to what we just mentioned then 19% to 29%

326
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:06,720
and then 50% and all that but this is to be import exporter of GDP but it's another version of

327
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,360
the peak globalization but this is quite different if we look at this what if we look at this

328
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:23,039
because from 2-390 to 2020 the increase from 50% to 42% if we take this look in details

329
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:32,159
as we just mentioned the status here writes the from 60 to 90s this increase and then from around 90

330
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,639
the trading booth starts growing much faster at the 2-390s because of global financial crisis

331
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:45,120
and also the trading shocks so people refer to this a great trade complex

332
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:51,200
claps in the world so globalization is now decalbellization of

333
00:27:51,200 --> 00:28:01,840
globalization or even desta and declining globalization but which does the same mean mistakes

334
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:10,799
because what we see just now is an overall situation in the world if we look the

335
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,559
individual countries with them China United States and Japan you're in union and some others

336
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:26,879
so it's the China all right they picked in 2008 instead of 2006 instead of 2008 and then

337
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:42,320
you're not a star it's then this you know states the black one 2011 and then Japan 2014

338
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:50,160
and you'll see European Union still moving out a bit so it's not big and this one decreased

339
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:56,560
to become this is the very special periods because of financial crisis so we cannot say this is

340
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:04,399
a for China actually this is because after financial crisis it decreased further but then for the

341
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:11,279
other three economies of financial crisis increased so it was the they are not picked

342
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,159
and here also shows that this economy made the economy

343
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:32,960
as trades as percentage of GDP from 70s to 2020 then these are even stated that they are

344
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,680
increasing but we see they are increasing right they're increasing so not picked they're not

345
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:51,600
big and the larger trading goods is the traders if European Union has the single economy

346
00:29:51,600 --> 00:30:06,480
account for 30% China only 12% United States 11% then if we look at more countries the vertical

347
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:16,480
axis shows this one being the peak percentage changed between the the axis is the

348
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:24,160
percentage change of the trades in percentage of GDP rise there's a vertical from

349
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:36,560
2020 is a vertical one vertical check there's a difference between 2020 and 2009 and then

350
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:44,560
digital axis has to be the different between 2009 and 1990 and this is the this is a purist that's

351
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:51,200
done that faster growth period and this purist is a slow growth of globalization slow growth

352
00:30:51,519 --> 00:31:00,559
so if we see the difference between them and if we see that which could be the difference

353
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:10,000
in the slow growth period right if the growth rate of percentage is higher in the second

354
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,080
period then in the first period then they will be in the upper panel here as a more than 0%

355
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:29,839
right this is if it's higher than 2020 then 2008 if the percentage is higher in 2008 then 1990

356
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:38,480
they must be to the right because this will be positive so from this you can see here if this

357
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:48,000
country in both periods are negative that means 2008 is higher than 1990 and 2020 is higher than

358
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:56,960
2008 so they must be here you both a growth slow so all these countries might be peakers that means

359
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:05,920
it's percentage of trades in the GDP have decreasing or risk of highest and now decreasing including

360
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:15,920
front front document the Germany adds Australia and Sweden dependent damal

361
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:24,880
they are if they are over there then these are non-peekers okay it's that they're the

362
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:34,160
non-peekers so all of these are not not people they're still increasing like each one

363
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:40,560
you're in yielding and then maybe the national now the national national national

364
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:46,799
as well as them you get problems they're increasing so all other countries see not all the countries

365
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:54,399
start the peakers that is they're still in their percentage of trading GDP has still increasing

366
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:06,799
and also you can see here China's engaging to the world global change from 1995 to 2018

367
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:15,519
we are selling more in intermediate products to the world and finally

368
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:24,799
last sometimes maybe last or maybe similar roughly the same 1% about last 1% of the

369
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:33,200
intermediate from the world but it was more than 2% close to 3% of intermediate exports to the world

370
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:43,680
so why the trade goods ratio decrease overall the trade ratio decrease as a percentage of GDP

371
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:55,120
to the trade 20 GDP decrease then there must be some some things a lot but then if we look

372
00:33:55,199 --> 00:34:05,599
they're trading a decreasing we need to look at the water this trade of water and trade of values

373
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:12,000
right if they're they're not decreasing that what the important role of the

374
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:21,119
commensurate crisis crisis or suit cycles so this is the difference so if we look at this

375
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:31,759
into decomposing to details we'll see here the lots of world rich GDP and real exports actually

376
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:39,359
they're increasing for GDP the lots of increasing and then for export also increasing apart

377
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:45,599
their difference are the difference their access here this will be the last scale since they're

378
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:56,319
exports and also the so we'll see here the real GDP we're export to real GDP ratio now from

379
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:06,719
if we take the two-centre 15 and as 100 then we'll see now two some nights is one is three and two

380
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:15,199
are 2021 99% where close to each other so they're not really decreasing because right but a bit

381
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,719
a very small decrease for that then when we trade with other countries right so we see here

382
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:29,039
as decreasing the total goods export and decreasing but if we decompose into three categories

383
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:35,039
three industries there's agricultural products there's the raw material the mining fields and that

384
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:46,159
actions most in not all of this are decreasing but for agriculture a bit increase and for the

385
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:57,840
agriculture is increasing and only for this one and decrease but money and decreasing and we see

386
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:06,800
the manufacturing by the staff as we see here for agriculture are increasing for goods

387
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,200
the different goods are increasing only the mine and few mining field products are decreasing

388
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:27,760
from 2020 so the general the aggregate the aggregate decreasing is due to the raw material

389
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:38,960
actually see here right this is very clear the prices when we talk about trade we're talking about

390
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:48,320
the their values and the value is a is a quantitative times the price and the price will fuse

391
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,800
and the mining that decreasing so even if we trade the same content you would trade the same

392
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:02,800
but it's pricey decreasing then the value is decreasing stay there's a fuse and mine but for

393
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,760
agriculture products and manufacturing products they're not decreasing they're fast but this is

394
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:18,000
this is the only for the fuse and mine products okay so that's if we compared the the

395
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:27,119
trillion in mine and you might lose in the fields this is the trades in values and then this

396
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:35,119
is trading values means the content so we see the quantity the traded value are increasing the

397
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:43,440
quantity increasing but why the values are decreasing because the price are decreasing so it is not because

398
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,559
the trade are the trade the world smaller because the price are smaller and lower than before

399
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:57,920
so the trade of value is lower than before then in this case them if we look at the values

400
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:06,880
but not the world is we'll see trades are smaller than before but if we look at the quantities

401
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:15,840
who are trading more than before so that is globalization is still growing not the decreasing right

402
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:29,119
and also supply chains the supply chains are important because the production is not

403
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:37,279
today the production is not same as the centuries ago today the production of the final product

404
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:43,199
involve the import of the raw materials import its immediate products import of

405
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:50,639
many components from different countries and the assembly of final products and the production

406
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:59,279
base indicator for the end of of sure of sure it means the much national companies

407
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:08,400
are in the United States you are in union with advanced countries nations they locate some

408
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:16,239
production activities production tasks to developing countries right so from the second

409
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:26,239
as 1970s they are doing this they are located the production activities from one country to another

410
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:36,719
but today they have already maximized a location of all activities because say in 1970 all the

411
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:52,639
activities we have three activities say that we have three activities in the raw materials

412
00:39:52,639 --> 00:40:03,599
production assembled into final products all of this in 1960s up produced up performing in

413
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:11,920
the United States and then up dancing the off-shoreing some activity to other countries so this to

414
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:19,119
maybe two South East Asian countries and this remains in United States and this to some other

415
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:28,960
countries okay so starting to off-shoreing some of this production tasks to the places where

416
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:38,079
the production efficiency is highest or the cost is lowest and then from 1960s 90s to today to two

417
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:46,720
thousands now the fourth decades or three decades right they already have located the

418
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:55,519
activities to the places we should run to low cost there's no further places they can find to

419
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:03,840
locate to further locate to under-press it so for example the cost here is the cost of 50

420
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:11,840
they cannot find any place lower the cost of low their 50 no place they can find so that is

421
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,360
the choice between these locations from see that is the China and this maybe that's the

422
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:30,960
in China okay they already this is already the location best performed this task and this is

423
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:38,000
the location that's the performance task with high efficiency so no reason to move them from

424
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,559
China to other countries or from China to other locations so that is the this is what is said

425
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:53,039
the end of off-shoreing expansion of facts no expansion of such an off-shoreing they already

426
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:59,840
includes everything in their right places so folks on the show to merit right activity the job

427
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:11,840
is a bit bigger right so that's the foreign from sit to 5% to 29% in 2013 but the rules to sit

428
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:23,360
to 1% in 2018 and try to base the values of reshoring reshoring what does that mean so if the

429
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:30,320
United States are aren't going to be a performance in the United States and now some tasks they have to

430
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:37,920
to China this is this is of of short this of shorting so the activity is the movie from the United

431
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:49,200
States to China but now the the political reasons Biden or some others Obama they tried to move the

432
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,960
production activities from China from Mexico from Southeast Asian countries back to your states

433
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:03,840
and this is this is a reshoring this is a reshoring so share the intermediate imports and exports

434
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:11,280
there's a biggest manufacturing economy and not this engage in from supply chain if they move back

435
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:20,000
so there's not much of the trade of the of the imports of the intermediate products okay so that is the

436
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:28,400
from the countries at the same size and then we can see here we can see here share the world

437
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:38,079
manufacturing of GDP in in these countries g7 countries industrial six that's an emerging

438
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:49,360
countries in new industries countries it's share of the GP in the world for g7 countries decreased

439
00:43:49,360 --> 00:44:04,079
from 60% to 38% of 37% and in the 36 moved from 10% to 35% to 38% and the rest of the world's

440
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:17,760
rapidly signed 26% to 20% and here this will be the value added as crystalized across

441
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:25,600
productions what does the value added to mean the value added means them if we produce the

442
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:35,200
the products three stages raw materials and the production of the intermediate products and in

443
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:46,560
the final product so if we put this 50 okay and then here we got maybe a certain and it got

444
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:57,360
20 so we got a final product you can find the product is it's 100 and this is a gross value

445
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:06,400
but this 20 30 and 50 is a value added okay it's about added so there isn't decreasing because

446
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:14,559
there's not much trade between the AP service or the some of the decreasing and then we will discuss

447
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:20,239
this on next time that's so much but still

448
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:20,400
all

449
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:37,599
what

450
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,279
but i drifted in the animation

451
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,079
so you don't go to fighting

452
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:50,920
when i'm fighting, i try my best

453
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:54,319
otherwise i do the action

454
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,779
well, now will try my single

455
00:46:57,779 --> 00:46:58,279
wow

456
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:01,699
what do u do ?

457
00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:03,799
lets write a speech

458
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,099
LC

459
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:05,920
ok

460
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:06,860
ok

461
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,599
It's okay, it's okay if you go over it, boys

462
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:23,299
They're going to go over the thread

463
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

464
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

465
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

466
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

467
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

468
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

469
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

470
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

471
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

472
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

473
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

474
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

475
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

476
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,599
I'm going to put it on the top.

477
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,599
I'm going to put it on.

478
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,599
It's going to be nice and long.

479
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:58,599
It's going to be nice too.

480
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:00,599
To be nice and long.

481
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:03,079
That's just shorts.

482
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:35,319
I'm going to have to go back to the

483
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:37,319
next day.

484
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:38,319
I'm going to have to go back to the

485
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,319
next day.

486
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:40,319
I'm going to have to go back to the

487
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,319
next day.

488
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:42,319
